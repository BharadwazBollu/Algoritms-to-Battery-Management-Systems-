 I advice evreryone who use this repository to try their best for the course projects and quiz. Only use this when you are anout to give up. As I saw in discussion section, many people are struggling for some quiz and project solutions. This is my small contribution to those poeple.
 
 My sincere thanks to Gregory Plett who taught all the courses with key insights and application in practice.
