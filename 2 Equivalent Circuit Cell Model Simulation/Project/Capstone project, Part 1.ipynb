    "This Jupyter notebook operates in the same way as all of the other Jupyter notebooks that you have used so far in this course. You can type Octave code into notebook cells and execute that code to see how it functions. This allows you to test your code fully before submitting it for grading.\n",

    "The goal of Part 1 of the capstone project is to write an Octave function that simulates a single lithium-ion battery cell. You will start with some sample code that simulates a single lithium-ion battery cell at a constant temperature. You will modify this code to enable simulation where the temperature changes with time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in a \"state-space\" model, there is no ambiguity when applying a time-varying temperature to the output equation. In our case, the output is voltage. So, voltage \"now\" equals a function of other variables \"now\" and the cell constants evaluated at the temperature \"now\". However, the state equation involves two different points in time. That is, \"next state\" equals a function of the \"present state\" and the \"present temperature\" and therefore parameter values at the \"present temperature\". Or, if we look at the expression a different way, we can say \"present state\" equals a function of the \"prior state\" and the \"prior temperature\" and therefore parameter values at the \"prior temperature\". \n",
